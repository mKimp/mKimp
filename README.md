ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kim. Nice to meet you.
I am a career changer with two years of full-stack web development experience specializing in Javascript, Typescript, React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL. I worked at two companies in full-stack and software development roles. I am naturally curious and perpetually working on improving my skills continually. Feel like saying Hello? You can contact me at phuongkim.ma@gmail.com.
